## Description
<!-- Explain what changes were made and why -->

## Version Bump Checklist
- [ ] I have updated `version.txt` with a new version number.
- [ ] I have verified that the new version follows semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

## Additional Notes
New builds should be made via concourse and follow the internal release guidelines documented on confluence.
