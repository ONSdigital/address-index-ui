# Address Index Matching Service

The UI is designed to access endpoints in the official service. A demo is publicly available with a small, example dataset.

This allows users to deploy and test both the API and the User Interface using a combination of `docker-compose up` in this directory and `python -m flask run` in the parent directory.

This docker compose file is also used during the Continuous Intergration testing when the UI is tested.
