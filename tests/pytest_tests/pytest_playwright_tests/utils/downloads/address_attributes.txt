Classification Code: A code that describes the classification of the record.

Classification Code List: The broken down Classifications Hierarchy of an address

Confidence Score: An overall match confidence percentage obtained from a Sigmoid function that uses the search engine scores and the calculated bespoke scores of all the results in the set. Scores over 70 can be taken as the clear winner, whilst scores around 50 usually indicate some ambiguity. The API can filter out scores below a certain threshold.

Formatted Confidence Score: The "Confidence Score" with a "%" appended, rounded to 2dp.

Country Code: The country in which a record can be found. This is calculated by performing an intersection with OS Boundary Line. This means records such as wind and fish farms will be assigned a value of ‘J’. E = England W = Wales S = Scotland N = Northern Ireland L = Channel Islands M = Isle of Man J = Not assigned to a country as it falls outside of the land boundaries used.

Formatted Address: Capitalized address that's the most human readable

Formatted Address (NAG): Capitalized address that's the most human readable. Sourced from NAG

Latitude: A value defining the Latitude location in accordance with the ETRS89 coordinate reference system.

Longitude: A value defining the Longitude location in accordance with the ETRS89 coordinate reference system.

LPI Logical Status: Logical status of this address record as given by the local custodian. This attribute shows whether the address is currently live provisional or historic. 1 = Approved 3 = Alternative 6 = Provisional 8 = Historical

Parent UPRN: UPRN of the parent Record if a parent child relationship exists.

Underlying Score: The raw document match score from the search engine. It is best used as a relative score so 20 is better than 5. Scores tend to be in the range 0-30.

[PAF] Dependent Thoroughfare: In certain places for example town centres there are named thoroughfares within other named thoroughfares for example parades of shops on a high street where different parades have their own identity. For example KINGS PARADE HIGH STREET and QUEENS PARADE HIGH STREET. If a Dependent Thoroughfare is present a Thoroughfare value must also be present.

The first two–four characters of the postcode constituting the postcode area and the postcode district for example NW6. It is the part of the postcode that enables mail to be sent from the accepting office to the correct area for delivery.
